The project was completed in 4 Stages:

	1. Data Exploration
	2. Basic Statistical Analysis
	3. Time Series Analysis
	4. Model Tuning and Prediction


The steps that I took in each of these stages are explained and implemented in 'pred.ipynb' notebook. 
To keep things clean, I used a virtual environment.

In case you are unable to run the program on your installation of python, please use the 'requirements.txt' file to recursively install all required dependencies.
